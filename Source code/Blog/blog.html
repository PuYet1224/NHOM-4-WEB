                <h4>ONE GREAT READER, SERIES 3, NO. 15: ADRIAN DANNATT</h4>
                <p>We're very pleased to have writer, curator, artist, and critic Adrian Dannatt as our guest for the final interview of One Great Reader, Series 3. We've been fans of his insider view of all things art-world since coming across his column for The Art Newspaper in the early 2000s. His tone is that of an endlessly curious, self-effacing bon vivant; gossipy, knowing, literate, and with a touch of theatric English flourish. In other words, good fun. We're glad interviewer Wes Del Val discovered him too, and we hope you enjoy Adrian's generous outpouring of recollections, reconsiderations, and recommendations as much as we do.
                This also marks our 45th One Great Reader interview overall (what a year!), and we look forward to taking a moment to collect what we've done so far, and doing some very fun things with it. Stay tuned!</p>
